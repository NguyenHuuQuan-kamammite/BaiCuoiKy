  description: Please, you have to help me! My little brother, Finn, he's always
    so curious... he went poking around the abandoned mine and got bitten by a giant
    scorpion. The town alchemist brewed this Antitoxin, but I can't get to him! The
    mine is crawling with giant rats, and I'm no fighter. He's hiding in the first
    storage chamber, just past the entrance. Please, take this and bring it to him
    before it's too late
