  description: You there! Adventurer! We've got a problem. The old cemetery on the
    eastern hill, just outside town, has become... active. Skeletons are clawing
    their way out of the ground, and they're starting to wander too close to the
    farmsteads. We're stretched thin as it is. Could you help us?
