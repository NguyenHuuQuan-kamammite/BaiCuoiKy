  description: 'The roads near [Town Name] are no longer safe. Travelers speak of
    a coordinated trio of monsters: a Corrosive Slime that devours armor and flesh
    alike, a Cunning Archer who never misses from the shadows, and a Devious Mage
    who bends the very elements to his will. They have formed a deadly symbiosis,
    picking off caravans and anyone who dares to travel alone. For the safety of
    the region, this Triad of Turmoil must be eliminated. Find their lair and put
    an end to their reign.'
